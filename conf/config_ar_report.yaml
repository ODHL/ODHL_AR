  Whole-genome sequencing analysis is a rapidly evolving technology. Whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide variant analysis will continue to be adjusted and refined over time due to the varied nature of bacterial genomes, limitations on available reference genomes and continual assessment of the inclusion of mobile genetic elements in this analysis. These results represent the most advanced method currently available for genome comparisons.
heatmap.text: |
  The number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between each sample is shown on the heatmap below. The samples are ordered based on the Euclidean distance between each sample. Column and row colors indicate species.
heatmap.outbreak.text: |
  The number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between each sample is shown on the heatmap below. The samples are ordered based on the Euclidean distance between each sample. Column colors indicate species. Row colors first indicate projectID and second, indicate species.
tree.text: |
  Phylogenetic trees visualize the relatedness and genetic diversity of samples. Closely related samples will generally share a recent common ancestor. Three different types of trees are presented.
ar_gene_summary.text: |
  This report shows a summary of all antimicrobial resistance genes detected using the ODH [AR pipeline](https://github.com/ODHL/AR_Workflow).
